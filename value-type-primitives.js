// Variables can have on of the two types
// Value types or Reference types
// Value types also called primitives
let name = 'Anub'; // String Literal (Literally its a String!)
let age = 37; // Number Literal
let weight = 77.8; // Number Literal
// We don't have float and int as available primitives in JS
let isSmart = true; // Boolean Literal
let isLazy = false; // Boolean Literal
let politicalPreference = undefined; // undeclared or not defined. defined != assigned
let selectedCar = null; // null is an object
// let symbolVariable = Symbol ??
console.log(typeof selectedCar); // typeof is an unary operator

// statically typed vs dynamically typed
// JS is a dynamically typed 
// that is to say, variables can have their type changed after 
// they have been assigned a value
// C is statically typed
